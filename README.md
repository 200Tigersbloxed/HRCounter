## DATA SOURCES
### Pulsoid
1. Open your pulsoid [widgets configuration page](https://pulsoid.net/ui/configuration).
2. Copy the link behine `Feed reference` in the **Advanced** section at the bottom of the page.
3. Paste this link in the config file.

Notice: The link should start with `https://pulsoid.net/v1/api/feed/...`.

### Galaxy Watch
1. Use [HeartRateToWeb](https://github.com/loic2665/HeartRateToWeb) and [this](https://galaxystore.samsung.com/geardetail/tUhSWQRbmv) app on your watch.
2. Follow the instrucrion on [their github page](https://github.com/loic2665/HeartRateToWeb) to set up heart rate broadcast.
3. Use [from file](https://github.com/loic2665/HeartRateToWeb#from-file) or [from /hr endpoint](https://github.com/loic2665/HeartRateToWeb#from-hr-endpoint) in the [OBS](https://github.com/loic2665/HeartRateToWeb#obs) section of HeartRateToWeb instructions.
4. If you decide to use "from file", then use the path to the `hr.txt` file generated by HeartRateToWeb as `file:///PATH/TO/THE/FILE`.
5. If you decide to use "/hr endpoint", then enter the feedlink as `http://YOUR_IP:YOUR_PORT/hr`

For example: `"FeedLink": "file:///D:/example/folder/hr.txt",` and `"FeedLink": "http://192.168.1.100:6547/hr",`

### Others
When thie mod is requesting hr data, it expects a string contining one of these:
* A json as `{"bpm":120,"measured_at":"SOME STRING"}`
* Only numerical digits. (Regex `^\d+$`)

It can be in a file or can be requested from a link. 

## Settings
### All the options except the color values and feed link can be changed in game. 
Here is a table for all the setting options if you want to edit config file instead.
